### Hi! Thanks for looking me up!

#### ▶️ I’m currently looking for a career kickstart! I am a Biochemistry MSc interested in green chemistry, molecular dynamics, data analysis and visualization, and programming! I'm looking for an opportunity in a tech related field that may (or may not!) make use of my skills in chem and biochem.

##### 🤹 I can write scientifically, think critically, deliver a great presentation, and above all learn heavier subjects quickly and efficiently (something I am used to!)

##### 🧠 I am deepening my intermediate knowledge of python and starting to learn SQL!

##### 📫 e-mail me at afonso.martins@ua.pt!

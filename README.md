### Hi! Thanks for looking me up!

##### ▶️ I’m currently looking for a career kickstart! I am a Biochemistry MSc interested in green chemistry, molecular dynamics, data analysis and visualization, and programming!       ­­­I'm looking for an opportunity in a tech related field that may (or may not!) make use of my skills in chem and biochem.

##### 🤹 I can write scientifically, think critically, deliver a great presentation, and above all learn heavier subjects quickly and efficiently (something I am used to!)

##### 🧠 After getting the hang of python, I’m currently learning R for data science!

##### 📫 How to reach me: e-mail me at afonso.martins@ua.pt!
